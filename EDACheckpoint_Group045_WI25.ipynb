        "This project aims to explore how various factors affect the sale price of houses in San Francisco. Alexander Fromm Lurie, a San Francisco real estate advisor with Compass, “[San Francisco] The Bay Area has among the strongest economies in the world, which attracts talent and infuses an abundance of money in the region.” Real estate markets can be highly variable, with certain features of a property such as its size, location, and age, that often have a significant influence on its value. By analyzing a dataset of housing prices in San Francisco, this project aims to understand the relationship between sale price and key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and year built. The main objective is to identify which of these independent variables most strongly predict the sale price of homes, which can offer relevant information for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate investors.\n",
        "\n",
        "This topic has been explored and numerous cases have been done figuring out the why. The article by The Own Team explores the biggest factors influencing home prices today. The author, Wilson Leung, explains that a strong job market and economic growth tend to push prices up, while high interest rates can slow down demand. Location remains key, with desirable neighborhoods, school districts, and amenities significantly affecting property values <a name=\"#cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).

        "Kara Maria Kockelman’s research on 'The Effects of Location Elements on Home Purchase Prices and Rents: Evidence from the San Francisco Bay Area' highlights the effects of locational factors on home prices and rent in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her study reveals that properties with better access to job centers, highways, and public transit tend to have higher values, and homes with shorter commute times are also priced higher. Neighborhood features, such as income levels, amenity accessibility, and crime rates also affect housing costs <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). This seemed to be similar to a subsection that our team would like to answer. Environmental factors, including pollution levels and scenic views, also play a significant role in determining property values. By employing regression models, the study quantifies these impacts, which ultimately resulted in the finding that location-based factors—such as accessibility, neighborhood quality, and environmental conditions—collectively account for significant variations in home prices and rents. Similarly to our team’s research question, this study underscores the importance of these features in the value of real estate.\n",

While these features appear strongly correlated with higher sale prices, it’s important to consider potential nonlinear relationships, as individual buyer preferences may affect how these factors influence pricing.\n",

        "When analyzing how various features (square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, year built) influence home prices in a city, it’s crucial to address ethical concerns related to data privacy, bias, and equitable analysis. Data privacy must be protected by ensuring that personal identifiable information, such as exact addresses, is removed, and that the dataset is used in compliance with what was agreed upon prior. Bias can arise if certain neighborhoods or house types are overrepresented, leading to skewed results. To detect these issues, exploratory data analysis (EDA) can help identify missing or unbalanced data distributions. Using interpretable models ensures that pricing determinants remain transparent and accountable.\n",

        "Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis is essential when studying the relationship between housing features and sale prices. Model selection plays a crucial role, as different regression techniques, such as linear regression or tree-based models, may yield varying results. It is important to evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R² to assess predictive accuracy. Furthermore, feature selection techniques, including multicollinearity checks and principal component analysis (PCA), can help refine the model by eliminating redundant or insignificant variables. Data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, normalizing continuous variables, and encoding categorical variables, ensures consistency and improves predictive performance. Lastly, cross-validation should be employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data, reinforcing the credibility of the analysis.\n"
